A simple side scrolling game where you control a dinosaur that moves up when you click the space bar. There will be obstacles moving to the left that you must avoid. If you have a collision with one, the game will end.

Technology used is Jquery CSS and HTML. I incorporated collision detection via the pythagorean theorem. I implemented a garbage collection function so that there are not an excessive amount of divs at the end of the game. Lastly, I used a sprite sheet and css animations to make my images come to life.

My approach was to first just get an element to be able to jump over another. Then I wanted to make sure that if they touch, I would be alerted. Lastly, I wanted the obstacles to be randomized so that you cannot predict the timing of them.

One quick future feature would be to make the ground move. I would like to eventually make it mobile. Another would be to make a smoother jumping feature. The last would be manipulate the timing of obstacles so that it is not impossible once the speed is at its fullest.

There aren't any bugs that I know of, however I am sure you could find some.

The biggest win/challege was getting collision detection, as that is something we have not gone over and had to learn on my own. I also got it working pretty quickly after about half a days research.

My web design was very simple, with a basic box model with header, body, and footer. All with a slick and clean black/grey color scheme.
